Hi 

I hope you're doing well and enjoying the curriculum. Just a heads-up that I'm not currently on WhatsApp for personal reasons, as I'm focusing on building projects and my studies, and social media has become a distraction.

Following our previous approach for the last submission, you can reach me on GitHub Chat to continue our conversation.

Regarding the upcoming hackathon, I'm developing a HealthTech App for my final project and see the hackathon as a valuable opportunity to explore a specific aspect of its UX journey. I thought this could be something we could potentially collaborate on. If you're interested in working together on this, please let me know first thing in the morning or right after the MERN Class so we can discuss it further on Google Meet. I'll send the meeting link in an email tomorrow morning.

Should we proceed, Kindly FORK the Repo
Then proceed to editing as per agreed brief on your device

Kind regards,
